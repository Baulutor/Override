# Level06

This level is a crypted password that we need to get.

`auth()` function is the one we gonna take to make print what is the result

Since the function use the login to make the password we just need to print what the result of the encryption is with which login and it works.

there is just this, that indicate that the login must be 6 lenght at least.

    if ((int)sVar1 < 6) {
    uVar2 = 1;
    }

### Exemple

    login :             cccccc
    password will be :  6232799
